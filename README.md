        - How can you organize the content to support user's goals?
        - Which info should be most prominent? Where should your main message go? What should users first see?
        - What will the user expect to see on certain pages?
        - Which buttons or touch points does the user need to complete the desired actions?

        - Simple instructions
        - Trust building elements
        - Toolstips
    * After detailing run tests
